BUIDLHub is a no-code solution for passing data between on-chain and traditional web and to ultimately change our relationship with technology. It's essentially IFTTT for web3.0.

# Web3.0, Web2.0, Done!

The data that passes between products and services in our life are siloed. Even in web3.0, we generally use non-financial apps in isolation.

Despite all the advancement of SaaS, our relationship with tech is still quite janky. We need a way to connect the data about ourselves, purchased products, and subscribed services together without having it stolen, sold without us knowing, or used to track us.

However, web3.0 industry participants, who created the connections to perform these functions, struggle with usability, aligning incentives, and growing their user base.

BUIDLHub proposes a no-code, easy-to-use automation platform to help innovators spin up workflows built atop the greatest and latest decentralized apps so we can optimize our lives one step at a time. We also embed BUIDLHub forms on other pages so you can programmatically spin up flows.

Want to experiment with the future? Here's your chance!

# Get Started Now

Read on about the intent and vision of BUIDLHub or jump into one of the Getting Started tutorials.

Use BUIDLHub to turn dapps into Rest APIs, subscribe to on-chain events, get updates via email or webhooks, or wire Telegram and Discord chatbots to on-chain data and get the latest from dapps on the go. You’re able to connect your smart contract and scale up your new developer onboarding process. The best part is, BUIDLHub is built to complement no-code dapp development tools.

# How it Works

We can to promote these existing products and services by encouraging dapp developers to contribute their insider knowledge into making useful apps. These users can define applications within BUIDLHub. They then have the option of setting these customized new apps from "private" to "public", thereby, after screening and the green light by the BUIDLHub team, allowing any other users to plug the specifications of these apps and features into their flows.

So a manager of developer relations, developer, or product manager can go into BUIDLHub, add the information about their dapp (whether its live on mainnet or in a test net), and allow other users to immediately play with events on-chain.

Here's our approach:

1. We start by defining the app. Apps capture basic metadata, connectors, alerts, and query functions.
2. After an app's components have been defined, its features are ready for testing and made available to the individual user in the Flow Designer.
3. In the Flow Designer, a user can either 1) select their app as a trigger, or 2) have one of their app's predefined, on-chain properties or functions serve as a condition to be met to enable downstream events in the flow.
4. In the Flow Designer, to make both of these tasks even simpler, the user can connect it with pre-made actions and effects.
5. Predefined routing options make it easy to spin up a callable endpoint, send a message off, and make the enriched, formatted data response useful for some other app.

# Using these Docs

You never have to touch advanced configuration to get something working. Our **Getting Started guides** will provide all necessary information for you to have something pulling on-chain data and giving you something to plug into your app.

When you load up BUIDLHUb, you'll be routed to a "Welcome" page:

![welcome](https://github.com/BUIDLHub/docs/gatsby-gitbook-starter/src/assets/images/welcome.png)

You can either choose to Design a Flow or Connect an App. First time users should click Design a Flow, whereas users that are trying to enable their own application to incorporate into a flow should return back here to Connect an App.

# Why Should You Care?

How can you feasibly decentralize the internet if every website acts like an independent mobile phone app?

We'd like to think we're playing a role in changing the blockchain developer paradigm. Designing the callable smart contract functions and making the language consistent with unstandardized design practices is a second, third priority—or not even a priority at all to many blockchain developers. We want to make this line of thinking standard across our industry.Our mission is to give blockchain product development teams a tool that expands their adoption and make it easier to introduce their products and services to your own projects. In order to do this, we need to help contribute to a shared perspective on how to interpret and communicate with data on-chain.
